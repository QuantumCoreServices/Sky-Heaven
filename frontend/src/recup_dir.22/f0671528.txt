de on each line of disassembled output.
    The value given to 'annotate' must be an integer and is used as a
    hint for the column where annotation should start.  The default
    value is 0, meaning no annotations.

    In addition to printing the disassembly, some sanity checks are made:

    + All embedded opcode arguments "make sense".

    + Explicit and implicit pop operations have enough items on the stack.

    + When an opcode implicitly refers to a markobject, a markobject is
      actually on the stack.

    + A memo entry isn't referenced before it's defined.

    + The markobject isn't stored in the memo.

    + A memo entry isn't redefined.
