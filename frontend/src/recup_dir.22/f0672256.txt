f times this function was called, not counting direct
          or indirect recursion,
    [1] = Number of times this function appears on the stack, minus one
    [2] = Total time spent internal to this function
    [3] = Cumulative time that this function was present on the stack.  In
          non-recursive functions, this is the total execution time from start
          to finish of each invocation of a function, including time spent in
          all subfunctions.
    [4] = A dictionary indicating for each function name, the number of times
          it was called by us.
