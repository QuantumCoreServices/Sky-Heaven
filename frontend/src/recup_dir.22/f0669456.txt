on's parameters.

    A tuple of four things is returned: (args, varargs, keywords, defaults).
    'args' is a list of the argument names, including keyword-only argument names.
    'varargs' and 'keywords' are the names of the * and ** parameters or None.
    'defaults' is an n-tuple of the default values of the last n parameters.

    This function is deprecated, as it does not support annotations or
    keyword-only parameters and will raise ValueError if either is present
    on the supplied callable.

    For a more structured introspection API, use inspect.signature() instead.

    Alternatively, use getfullargspec() for an API with a similar namedtuple
    based interface, but full support for annotations and keyword-only
    parameters.

    Deprecated since Python 3.5, use `inspect.getfullargspec()`.
    zhinspect.getargspec() is deprecated since Python 3.0, use inspect.signature() or inspect.getfullargspec()r
