    words formed from them. So mostly two strings which sound the same when
    you pronounce them are considered equal. Printer manufacturers do not
    market two models whose names sound the same but differ only by
    upper/lower case, spaces, dashes, ..., but in printer drivers names can
    be easily supplied with these details of the name written in the wrong
    way, especially if the IEEE-1284 device ID of the printer is not known.
    This way we get a very reliable matching of printer model names.
    Examples:
    - Epson PM-A820 -> epson pm a 820
    - Epson PM A820 -> epson pm a 820
    - HP PhotoSmart C 8100 -> hp photosmart c 8100
    - hp Photosmart C8100  -> hp photosmart c 8100

    @type strin: string that can be the make or the model
    @return: a normalized lowercase string in which punctuations have been replaced with spaces.
