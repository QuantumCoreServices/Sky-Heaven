 scanned far enough ahead such we're confident we won't see any
    more messages for this event?). Thus the threshold for when to
    expire an event from the cache during static log file scanning is
    determined not by wall clock time but rather by the oldest
    timestamp in the cache (e.g.there is enough spread between
    timestamps in the cache its reasonable to assume the event is
    complete). One might ask in the case of log file scanning why not
    fill the cache until EOF is reached and then sweep the cache?
    Because in log files it is not unusual to have thousands or tens
    of thousands of events and the cache would grown needlessly
    large. Because we have to deal with the real time case we already
    have code to keep only the most recent events in the cache so we
    might as well use that logic, keep the code paths the same and
    minimize resource usage.
