ease after 4.1.7, but I've left
   a gap just in case.
** We now use an "imported" version of gnulib, rather than including
   a copy of the gnulib code in our CVS repository.   There are no
   differences in the build instructions, though (unless you are
   building directly from CVS, in which case please read the file
   README-CVS).
** There are no (deliberate) functional changes in version 4.1.20.
