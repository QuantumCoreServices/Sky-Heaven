a and saves it
        (by default) as webm video under a filename derived from
        @file_template. The template is either a relative or absolute
        filename which may contain some escape sequences - %d and %t
        will be replaced by the start date and time of the recording.
        If a relative name is used, the screencast will be saved in the
        $XDG_VIDEOS_DIR if it exists, or the home directory otherwise.
        The actual filename of the saved video is returned in @filename_used.
        The set of optional parameters in @options currently consists of:
            'draw-cursor'(b): whether the cursor should be included in the
                              recording (true)
            'framerate'(i): the number of frames per second that should be
                            recorded if possible (30)
            'pipeline'(s): the GStreamer pipeline used to encode recordings
                           in gst-launch format; if not specified, the
                           recorder will produce vp8 (webm) video (unset)
