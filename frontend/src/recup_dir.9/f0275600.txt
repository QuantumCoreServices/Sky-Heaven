* xgettext --language=GCC-source now recognizes also the format strings
  used in the Fortran front-end of the GCC compiler, and marks them as
  'gfc-internal-format'.

* autopoint can now be used to update several PO directories all together.

* PO mode changes:
  - PO files with plural entries are now correctly handled.
  - Editing a message with previous msgid (in comments) removes these
    comments.  Contributed by Noritada Kobayashi.

* The po/Makevars file has a new field MSGMERGE_OPTIONS, that can be used
  to adjust msgmerge's operation.

* The use of the macro AM_GNU_GETTEXT without 'external' argument and the
  --intl option of the gettextize program are deprecated and will be removed
  in the next release. Instead of including the intl sources in your package,
  we suggest making the libintl library an (optional) prerequisite of your
  package.

* Updated the meaning of 'gcc-internal-format' to match GCC 4.3.

* Installation options:
  The configure options --without-cvs and --with-git can be used to specify
  whether 'autopoint' will use the 'cvs' program, or the 'git' program, or
  none at all. These options allow to trade dependencies against installed
  package size: If --without-cvs is specified and --with-git is not specified,
  'autopoint' will not rely on 'cvs' or 'git', but will instead rely on a
  locally installed a 3 MB large archive.

* Portability:
  - The msgfilter program now also works on native Woe32 platforms.
  - Compiled C# message catalogs now also work with 'mono' versions from 2009
    or newer.
