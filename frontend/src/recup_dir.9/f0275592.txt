DIRS in configure.ac.

* Portability:
  - msginit now does not require GNU sed.
  - The Makefile rule for generating en@quot and en@boldquot now uses
    @SED@ variable instead of hard-coded 'sed' command to allow users
    to supply GNU sed.

* Future backward-incompatibilities:
  - In future Gettext versions, the files installed by 'gettextize'
    will require Automake 1.10 or later.  This will improve the
    compatibility of user projects with newer Automake versions.
