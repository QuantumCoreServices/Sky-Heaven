In the unlikely event that you are employed on a continuing basis to do
translation, we may need a disclaimer from your employer as well, to assure
your employer does not claim to own this work.  Please contact the FSF to
ask for advice if you think this may apply to you.

Note: if you want the wording modified to cover only a specific category
of programs, or a specific program, we can easily do that.
