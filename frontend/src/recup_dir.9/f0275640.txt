* PO mode changes:
  - New key bindings for 'po-previous-fuzzy-entry',
    'po-previous-obsolete-entry', 'po-previous-translated-entry',
    'po-previous-untranslated', 'po-undo', 'po-other-window', and
    'po-select-auxiliary'.
  - Support for merging two message catalogs, based on msgcat and ediff.

* A fuzzy attribute of the header entry of a message catalog is now ignored
  by the tools, i.e. it is used even if marked fuzzy.

* gettextize has a new option --intl which determines whether a copy of the
  intl directory is included in the package.

* The Makefile variable @INTLLIBS@ is deprecated. It is replaced with
  @LIBINTL@ (in projects without libtool) or @LTLIBINTL@ (in projects with
  libtool).

* New packaging hints for binary package distributors. See file PACKAGING.

* New documentation sections:
  - Manipulating
  - po/LINGUAS
  - po/Makevars
  - lib/gettext.h
  - autoconf macros
  - Other Programming Languages
